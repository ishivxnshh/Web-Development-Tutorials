    <p>Atoms of radioactive elements can split. According to Albert Einstein, mass and energy are interchangeable under
        certain circumstances. When atoms split, the process is called nuclear fission. In this case, a small amount of
        mass is converted into energy. Thus the energy released cannot do much damage. </p>
